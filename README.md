# WeatherDuck 🦆⛅️

WeatherDuck was a part of a school project and was a simple weather app used for mobiles.
It's built as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)**, so you can add it directly to your home screen like a regular app.

**Try it here:** [https://weatherduck.netlify.app/](https://weatherduck.netlify.app/)

The design is made for phones with a screen size of around **360x800**, so it looks best on mobile.
